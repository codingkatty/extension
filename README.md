I made this cool thing because sometimes, I just want to quickly jot down something, esspecially when I'm watching some videos, and I want to do some calculations. There are also some other times, where I want to draw something online but I need a reference.

## Functions
- Move anywhere you want <br>
The window can be moved anywhere of your liking

- Colors <br>
Click the header to change color (darkmode/lightmode)

- Images <br>
Drag and drop images/gif to the window to reference

## How to Install
To use it, you can clone this repo <br>
`git clone https://github.com/codingkatty/extension.git`

Make sure you're using Chrome. Then, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions/). Toggle 'Developer mode', and you should see a 'Load unpacked' button.

Click on it and select the cloned repo. The extension should show up. Reload any tab that you want to use the extension on before trying.
